<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
  <LI>Manipulate 2D arrays of objects.</li>
  <LI>Gain more practice with iteration and recursion.</li>
  <LI>Have a lot of fun!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Preparation for this assignment</h2>


As you know, design must always precede implementation. You must
write pseudocode for each and every one of your
methods in this assignment, but I will not grade them nor do you have
to submit them. However, <b>you will have to show me your pseudocode
for each method you have a question about</b>. I will first help you
get the pseudocode right (if needed) before I can help with any implementation
issue. No (preliminary) pseudocode, no help from me.<BR><BR>


<h2>What you need to do</h2> 

<OL> 

  <LI>Download the code you will be building upon from Canvas, namely the file
<code>A1.zip</code> that contains a working
BlueJ project which you need to complete.</li>

<LI>The code you downloaded contains a small image-processing library
(i.e., the <code>Picture</code> class) that I wrote to help you
implement some nice visual effects pretty easily. You must consult the
documentation for the <code>Picture</code> class in BlueJ, under the
<code>Documentation</code> dropdown option in the top-right corner of the
editor window.  You *might*  also need to look up
the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/paint/Color.html">Java
API documentation for the built-in <code>Color</code> class.</a></li>

<LI>Study the provided <code>A1.java</code> file. You will have to
  properly plug in your code into this file.</li>
  
  <LI>For each part of the assignment listed below, you must write
    one or more methods that perform the corresponding
    effect. Design the method(s) using pseudocode, and then implement them
    in the <code>A1.java</code> file itself at the clearly indicated location
    for each part.
    
  <li>To test your program, right-click on the <code>A1</code> class
  in BlueJ and select the first option: <code>Run JavaFX
  application</code>. This will open up a window containing one picture
  and a collection of buttons (as shown below). Each button (except
  the first one) or pair of buttons corresponds to one part of this
  assignment.<br /><br />

<h2> Requirements</h2>

You must use iteration exclusively in parts 1 through 9.<br/><br/>

You must use recursion in part 10 only.<br/><br/>

For each one of parts 1 through 9, you must implement only the given methods.
You may NOT create any additional methods.<br/><br/>

For part 10, you must implement the provided method as well as at
least one other, recursive method. All of the methods you add for this
part must appear right after the <code>drawFractal()</code> method.<br/><br/>

You are not allowed to modify the given code, add any new import
statements or instance/class variables.<br/><br/>

As usual, for full credit, your code must be formatted and indented
professionally. It must not only pass all of my tests but also be as
concise as possible. All of the usual requirements common to all labs
so far also apply to assignments.<br/><br/>

The only methods you are allowed to call in this assignment are those
available in the <code>Picture</code> class, as well as one or more
methods in the <code>javafx.scene.paint.Color</code> class, but ONLY if
the functionality you need is not already provided in
the <code>Picture</code> class.<br/><br/>

Code that crashes, throws an exception, or produces incorrect output
for at least one picture will be penalized.

<h2> What to submit</h2>

When you are done with all parts, zip up your entire BlueJ project
folder (though you should only have modified the <code>A1.java</code>
file), and submit the resulting file named
<code>A1.zip</code> to the Canvas dropbox (under only ONE of the team
members' account) before the deadline above.

For full credit, your submission must load properly and work as is in BlueJ.
