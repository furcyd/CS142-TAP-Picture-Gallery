     <span style="font-size: 30px;">Part 1: Removing a color component</span></P>

<p>Each picture is a 2D array of pixels.  Each pixel has a color. Each
color, in the RGB scheme, has three components, namely red, green, and
blue. The value of each component is an integer between 0 and 255
inclusive.</p>

<p>In this first part of the assignment, you must take the picture
referred to by the instance variable <i>pic</i> and remove one of its
components, which simply means setting its value to 0.</p>

Consider the following original picture:<BR><BR>
<center>
<img src="./pics/beachOriginal.jpg" width=500>
</center>
<BR>

Here is what it should look like after you remove the red component,
the green component, or the blue component, respectively from left to
right. The last picture has both the green and blue components
removed.<BR><BR>

<center>
<img src="./pics/beachNoRed.jpg" width=250>
<img src="./pics/beachNoGreen.jpg" width=250>
<img src="./pics/beachNoBlue.jpg" width=250><br />
<img src="./pics/beachNoGreenNoBlue.jpg" width=250>
</center>
<BR><BR>
What should the picture look like when all three color components are
removed?


  <p>For this part of the assignment, you must implement both the
    <code>removeGreen()</code> and <code>removeBlue()</code>
  methods. To help you get started quickly on this assignment, I have
  given you the solution code for removing the red component.</p>
