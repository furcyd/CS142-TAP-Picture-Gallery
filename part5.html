In this part, you must rotate the picture counter-clockwise by 90
degrees. To help figure out the correct movement of pixels, you may
want to start working on paper with a small handwritten array of
pixels. You will quickly realize that you have to move rows of pixels
into columns of pixels in the right way. Implement the <code>rotateLeft()</code>
method that performs this transformation.<BR><BR>

Calling your method on this picture three times in a row:<BR><BR>

<center>
<img src="./pics/AbigailLeft0.jpg" width=300>
</center>
<BR><BR>
should produce the following sequence of pictures:<BR><BR>

<center>
<img src="./pics/AbigailLeft1.jpg" width=300>
<img src="./pics/AbigailLeft2.jpg" width=300>
<img src="./pics/AbigailLeft3.jpg" width=300>
</center>

<BR><BR> 

Of course, applying the rotation once more should give you back the
original picture without any loss of details.  <BR><BR>


Note that the original picture above happens to be a perfect square
(i.e., its width is equal to its height). Applying your method to a
rectangular (but non-square) picture would swap its width and
height. For this part of the assignment, <b>you do not have to change the
dimensions of the picture</b>. Instead, your <code>rotateLeft()</code> method
should simply perform the rotation on the top-left square corner of
the picture whose size is equal to the minimum value of the width and
height of the original picture.<BR>

For example, applying your method three times to this non-square picture (its
 width is larger than its height):<BR><BR>

<center>
<img src="./pics/abigail.jpg" width=300>
</center>
<BR><BR>

produces the following sequence of pictures:<BR><BR>


<center>
<img src="./pics/abigailRectLeft1.jpg" width=300>
<img src="./pics/abigailRectLeft2.jpg" width=300>
<img src="./pics/abigailRectLeft3.jpg" width=300>
</center>
<BR><BR>

As before, one additional application of your method would restore the original
picture.<BR><BR>
